  This website takes in user input and uses autocomplete to help the user find the starting and ending points of the route. The route is then shown on the map and the panel on the bottom left updates with the amount of energy needed to travel the specified route. The website utilizes Google Maps Javascript for the autocomplete, to display the route on the map, and to find the time and distance to travel each leg of the route so that it can be used to calculate the amount of energy needed. The car used in the model is based on the Tesla Model 3.
